# NYCJobs
This is an analysis of a dataset for job postings for the municipality of New York. Python was the analytical tool used for this analysis, along with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy libraries. The aim was to provide an overview of the municipalityâ€™s job market landscape. We explored the number of vacancies by municipal agencies, job categories, and career level showing the dynamics of employment opportunities within the city. Then delved into salary data, focusing on both average salaries and salary distributions, segmenting roles into three key categories: non-tech roles, tech roles, and analyst roles. This information is a valuable resource for job seekers especially those aspiring for data analyst careers to gain insight of job opportunities and salary expectations and consequently make informed choices.
